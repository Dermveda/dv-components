## About

Creates a span that hides the text visually, but is still available in the dom.
This is mostly for screen readers. This is similar to the [sr-only bootstrap class](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/screenreaders/).

## Usage

```javascript
import { Atoms } from '@dnovicki/dv-components';

<Atoms.HiddenText>hidden visually</Atoms.HiddenText>
```
