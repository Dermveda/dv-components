## About

The main container, think of this as similar to the [bootstrap container](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/overview/#containers) that wraps the entire page. This will set the max-width to `1850px` and center the page.

Only one main component should be present on the page at a time.

## Usage
```javascript
import { Atoms } from '@dnovicki/dv-components';

<Atoms.Main>
	<div>I am part of the main content</div>
</Atoms.Main>
```
